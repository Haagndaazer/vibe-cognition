# Vibe Cognition — Backlog

**Maintained by:** vince (planner/manager). **Source of truth** for what's shipped, what's
in flight, and what's queued. Derived from `docs/AUDIT-2026-06-10.md` (the ~70-finding audit)
and `docs/DESIGN-document-storage.md` (the v0.8.0 feature spine).

**Convention:** the proposed WP groupings below are a *triage inventory*, not briefs. Each WP
gets a peer-reviewed execution plan (a `docs/wp-*-plan.md`) before it's assigned to Vorpid, and
each ships through the standard gate (SHA-pinned merge, fix+proof same commit, voiding clause,
journal-flush-via-worktree). Last updated 2026-06-13 (v0.8.0 LIVE; P1+P2 + WP-Core-tail done; ledger now global; WP-Dash-tail in flight; only WP-Emb-non-E-3 + parked E-3 remain).

---

## In flight (Colton: continue the P3 tail)

| WP | Scope | State |
|----|-------|-------|
| **WP-Dash-tail** | Dashboard P3 cleanup (LOW/cosmetic, tiered): the dashboard over-query consistency (unify the fixed `limit*5` with the MCP adaptive widen, ledger 11); D-3 rest (auto-poll, `--no-embeddings` disabled state, search-wiring robustness); D-5 cosmetics (IPv6 `[::1]` host-check, dup neighbor-payload keys, drop unused context/severity from graph payload, port-constant dedup, ExitStack-on-timeout). | **Next for Vorpid** — plan + decorrelated peer-review. Branch off `3961f32` (vince aligns). |

### P3 tail remaining after WP-Dash-tail (near the bottom of the barrel)
- **WP-Emb (non-E-3)**: E-4 (concurrent PersistentClients), E-6 (code-search dead-code prune), E-7 (`revision=` pin on trust_remote_code, datetime.utcnow), E-8 (slow startup sync / dead generate_batch). Likely the last cluster.
- **E-3 query-prefix re-embed** — **PARKED, needs Colton's explicit go** (one-time full re-embed invalidates all existing vectors).

**Document-storage feature COMPLETE (D1a → D4) — stored, searchable, deletable, documented, dashboard:**
- **WP-D1a** (PR #8 → `870ff09`): DOCUMENT type + reference mode + sidecar (+deletion) + store/get + dedup + pair-level graph-inert matcher guard + sync-path embed guard.
- **WP-D1b** (PR #9 → `0faf302`): matcher 6-pair truth table + the ONE shared `documents_with_sha` predicate + copy mode (blob, ext whitelist, size/git policy, S3) + per-blob-path refcounted deletion + chunk-purge wiring + **N1 ghost-search fix** (MCP). Manual-edge guard → scope note.
- **WP-D2** (PR #10 → `dd11cd2`): documents **searchable** — chunked embeddings + **adaptive** over-query/dedupe + `matched_excerpt`; re-sync/backfill; `get_status` node/chunk split; **dashboard N1 SAFETY filter** (shared `search_hit_is_live`).
- **WP-D3** (PR #11 → `9afc538`): `/vibe-document` skill (S4/N3 link-by-`doc_ref`, WRONG-vs-RIGHT contrast) + surface fixes (all 17 tools, edge-type accuracy, `relates_to` 3-provenance) + doc-drift GUARD test.
- **WP-D4** (PR #12 → `6939c99`): dashboard document list + **token-gated path-safe download** (traversal-hardened: ../-/absolute/symlink/null all rejected via `is_relative_to` on the resolved path; reference→sidecar never the original; mime+filename header-injection clamped) + D-6 nav (dedupe-to-node) + D-1 liveness + **D-4 vendored cytoscape/fcose (no-CDN/SRI, offline)** + D-5 security (compare_digest, 400, clamp).

Seam principle held all five PRs: each creates nothing it can't delete. Six gate holds across the run, all resolved.

## v0.8.0 — ✅ RELEASED & PINNED LIVE
WP-R3 (PR #13 → `8f3079f`) cut the version bump + CHANGELOG; Colton cleared both human checks (vendored-libs render ✓, owed v0.7.4 non-ASCII journal test ✓) and gave the go; **Loki pinned the marketplace to `6c2ce12`** (real ls-remote HEAD; marketplace commit `09e6ab0`; teammate-comms `53827f8` untouched). Rollback if needed = re-pin v0.7.4 `20519b9`. Document storage is live to users. (H-6 also resolved: `.cognition/journal.jsonl` committed, `.cognition/chromadb/` gitignored.)

## Post-v0.8.0 audit-remainder — shipped (both P1s done)
- **WP-T** (PR #14 → `cc9cd73`): tool-layer correctness + pyright ratchet — T-9 (lifespan accessor, baseline **29→8**), T-2 (honest uncurated count), T-3 (batch partial-commit guard), T-6 (unified node_type/direction error contract), C-5 (surface add_edge False). First tests for the previously-untested MCP tool layer.
- **WP-ID** (PR #15 → `d585a22`): GLOBAL node-id-collision data-loss fix (P1) — mint-on-collision in `add_node`'s locked block (replay-safe by construction, documented), unified out the D1a document salt-retry, post-commit hook commit-hash discriminator, embedding-id rebind closes the orphan-vector. TOCTOU **shrunk** (backlog #2 residual documented, not eliminated). Closes the last P1 audit item.
- **WP-Cap** (PR #16 → `9876b43`, P2): `cognition_get_node`, persisted edge `reason` (replayed), `cognition_update_node` with re-embed-on-any-whitelisted-change (closes search-staleness for both the match vector AND the displayed context/severity metadata), exposed `get_superseded_chain`/`get_incident_resolution`. Held once on the context/severity metadata re-embed gap; fixed.
- **WP-Core-tail** (PR #17 → `3961f32`, P3): C-4 journal-FIRST-then-mutate on all 8 write paths (a failing append leaves no phantom in-memory write; all 8 sites guarded by fails-before append-failure tests asserting the raw graph), C-6 (documented why appends don't advance the offset — would corrupt the C-3 prefix-hash; log reworded), C-7 (path-based cycle detection — diamonds no longer mislabeled). Composes with WP-ID's add_node mint. Held once to complete the regression-guard set.

## Tracked follow-ups (from the document-storage run)
- **Dashboard search over-query** (recall, LOW): the dashboard `search()` uses a FIXED `limit*5` over-query while the MCP `_search_cognition` is ADAPTIVE (the D2 B3 fix). Same starve class, far more remote at the dashboard default limit=20 (~100-chunk single-doc domination needed), recall-only, secondary surface. Unify the over-query logic (ledger 11) or document as accepted residual.
- **mime/agent-controlled-header hygiene** (discovery `9dc4a49ac093`): resolved in D4 for the download mime; the general rule (clamp every agent-controlled value that reaches an HTTP header/path/query sink at your own boundary, never rely on the parser) is filed as a lesson.

---

## New feature ideas (parking lot)

- **Doc-serving tools for the LLM/user — esp. gated on empty-graph detection** (Colton, 2026-06-21): vibe-memory pioneered a pattern of MCP tools that exist specifically to SERVE DOCUMENTATION to the LLM (and through it, the user), most valuable when the server can DETECT the project has no memories/graph stored yet and proactively surface "here's what this is / how to begin recording." Adapt for vibe-cognition: an onboarding/explainer surface (a dedicated tool, or a `get_status` / `prime` path) that, on an empty or near-empty graph, serves start-here docs to the agent so it knows to begin capturing cognition rather than running blind. **Reference point: Reginald + the vibe-memory project** — that's where the pattern lives; ask Reginald / look at vibe-memory for the implementation. _(Meta: once the cross-project XP feature lands, this context becomes retrievable directly from vibe-memory's own graph without going through Reginald.)_

---

## Standing audits (recurring)

- **Tool-surface self-sufficiency audit** (Colton, 2026-06-21): every MCP tool and its description must let an LLM read it and know HOW to use it correctly **without any extra rules or prompting from the user** — the tool name, args, description, and return shape are the SOLE contract. **Re-run this audit every time a tool is added or changed** — it is not one-and-done; a new tool can quietly assume a convention the user would otherwise have to supply. Each pass: confirm every tool reads clearly in ISOLATION (no implicit user-supplied context required), args are unambiguous, return shapes are documented, and `"*"`/`project`/error semantics are stated. **Immediate scope:** the XP tools just shipped (`cognition_load_project` / `_unload_project` / `_list_projects`, and the new `project` arg on the read tools) — sweep those first. Pairs with the SKILL.md tool-table drift item (S-3).

## Audit remainder — proposed WP groupings (not yet briefed)

Priorities: **P1** ship-soon / high leverage · **P2** real correctness, lower urgency · **P3** polish/dead-code.

### WP-T · tool-layer correctness + pyright ratchet — ✅ SHIPPED (PR #14 → `cc9cd73`)
All five landed; pyright baseline **29 → 8**; the previously-untested MCP tool layer got its first tests.
- **T-9** ✅ `get_lifespan` accessor routed through all ~20 raw sites (baseline 29→9).
- **T-2** ✅ `storage.count_uncurated_nodes` (uncapped, mirrors the get-filter) → honest `total_uncurated`; free B2 test fix → baseline 8.
- **T-3** ✅ `isinstance(e, dict)` guard in the batch core — no more partial-commit crash.
- **T-6** ✅ one `_parse_node_type` + `_validate_direction`, unified `{"error": str}` shape (get_neighbors direction now an explicit error — intentional contract change).
- **C-5** ✅ `_add_edge_core`/batch surface `add_edge`'s False return.

### WP-ID · global node-id collision (data loss) — **P1** (surfaced by WP-D1a)
`generate_node_id` hashes `type:summary:timestamp`. Under a coarse clock (Windows ~15 ms),
two nodes of the **same type + same summary** recorded in one tick hash to the **same id**, and
`add_node` **silently overwrites** the first — silent data loss. WP-D1a fixed only the document
path (a local salt-retry in `_store_document`); `_record_node` (every decision/discovery/episode)
and the post-commit hook's hand-rolled id still collide. Discovery `e434566c8440`; defer decision
`0bd725b83bd0`. **Fix direction:** hoist a uniqueness loop (salt-until-`has_node`-free) **into
`add_node`'s locked block** (or a shared `storage.mint_unique_id`) so all writers benefit and the
cross-process `has_node`→`add_node` **TOCTOU** shrinks in the same change. Needs cross-writer
composition review — the post-commit hook reimplements id-gen (H-2 residue). Until then there's an
**interim asymmetry** (documents retry-on-collision, all other nodes overwrite) — tracked here so
it isn't mistaken for intent.

### WP-Cap · capability gaps — **P2** (synergy with the document track)
- **T-5** (MED, gap): no `cognition_get_node` (full `detail` unreadable after a search hit) and `update_node` is implemented+tested but unexposed. *Caveat: nothing re-embeds after `update_node` — must ship a re-embed path or search serves a stale summary forever (pairs with E-2). The document track's `get_document` is the graph's first get-by-id surface (audit G1) — coordinate so `get_node` isn't built twice.*
- **T-4** (MED, gap): curation `reason` is requested by the edge-analyzer then discarded — no field on `CognitionEdge`, dropped by the batch tool. Also the skill's top-level `source` tag doesn't reach the per-edge object (curated edges mislabel as `"batch"`). Persist the reason; fix the source plumbing.
- **T-11** (LOW, dead-code): `get_superseded_chain` / `get_incident_resolution` exported, tested, called by nothing — and the remove-node tool *recommends* `supersedes` chains no tool can traverse. Surface (synergy with WP-D1 versioning) or prune. (`get_incident_resolution` also has identical if/else branches.)

### WP-Emb · embeddings correctness — **P2**
- **E-3** (MED, bug): documents embedded with the **query** prefix (`generate_query_embedding`) instead of the document prefix — discards nomic's asymmetric-retrieval training, degraded ranking. **Fix requires a one-time collection re-embed (vector spaces incompatible) — coordinate, it invalidates all existing vectors.**
- **E-4** (MED, gap/inferred): two sessions open the same ChromaDB dir; PersistentClient isn't multi-process-safe (sqlite-lock errors feed E-2.3, stale per-process caches).
- **E-6** (MED, dead-code): code-search heritage — `bulk_upsert`, `delete_by_file/_by_repo`, `get_by_id`, `get_content_hashes`, `vector_search`'s never-written `repo`/`file_path_prefix` params, default `collection_name="code_embeddings"`. Prune, or put `bulk_upsert`+`generate_batch` to work in E-8.
- **E-5/E-7/E-8** (LOW–MED): backend/model-mismatch undetectable (no model/dims recorded in the collection); `datetime.utcnow()` deprecated; **`trust_remote_code=True` with no pinned `revision=`** (unpinned remote HF code at model load — worth pinning); error-shape mix in `vector_search`/`delete_embedding`; one-node-per-loop startup sync while `generate_batch`/`bulk_upsert` sit dead.

### WP-Core-tail · remaining core bugs — **P2/P3**
- **C-4** (MED, bug): mutate-then-journal with no rollback — if the append raises (disk full, AV lock), the in-memory graph keeps a phantom write nothing else will ever see. Journal-before-mutate ordering.
- **C-7** (LOW, bug): `get_reasoning_chain` marks diamonds (A→B→D, A→C→D) as cycles — `visited` is global to the traversal and never popped. Only linear chains are tested.
- **C-6** (LOW, noise): self-replay logs "caught up: +1 entries" on every process's own appends (`_append_journal` doesn't advance `_offset`). Benign; comment or advance offset on self-writes.

### WP-Dash · dashboard — **mostly SHIPPED in WP-D4**
- **D-1** ✅ DONE (WP-D4): `start_dashboard` polls `server.started`, returns failed (not a dead URL) if it never comes up.
- **D-2** ✅ already-fixed pre-D4 (ledger 23 re-verify: `_find_free_port` returns the bound port, not 0).
- **D-4** ✅ DONE (WP-D4): cytoscape/cose-base/fcose/layout-base vendored into `static/vendor/` — no CDN/SRI gap, works offline. (Human render-check owed at the v0.8.0 cut.)
- **D-6** ✅ DONE: SAFETY filter (WP-D2) + NAVIGATION dedupe-to-node + hydrate (WP-D4). (discovery `c7d948583b4e` resolved.)
- **D-5 (partial)** ✅ DONE in WP-D4: `secrets.compare_digest`, malformed-body→400, limit clamp. **OPEN (LOW):** `[::1]` IPv6 host-check, duplicate `type`/`edge_type` keys, unused `context`/`severity` in graph payload, hardcoded-port dedup, ExitStack-close-on-join-timeout.
- **D-3 (partial):** D-3a Refresh button ✅ DONE (WP-D4); D-3d deleted-episode-in-sidebar ✅ already-fixed (ledger 23). **OPEN (MED/LOW):** auto-poll, `--no-embeddings` "disabled" banner, search-wiring-attaches-only-on-init-success (a coherent UI-state cluster — own WP if pursued).

### WP-Doc/Skill — **P3**
- **S-2** (MED, bug): `agents/plan.md` frontmatter grants `Write, Edit` while the body says "READ-ONLY"; its MCP tool names (`mcp__vibe-cognition__*`) may not match the plugin namespace (`mcp__plugin_vibe-cognition_vibe-cognition__*`) — the Plan agent may get none of its cognition tools. *Verify namespacing in a live session before fixing.*
- **S-3** remainder (LOW): README standalone-dashboard instructions don't work for plugin users; SKILL.md tool table lists 10 of 15; edge-type list drifts (3 vs 4 vs 5); vibe-backfill says "consider" curate vs the MANDATORY rule; `instructions.py` claims prime is stdlib-only (imports pydantic/networkx) and references a non-existent PreCompact hook. (CHANGELOG ✓ done in WP-1.)
- **H-5** (LOW): both SessionStart entries fire on compact — re-running migrate_mcp post-compact is waste. Scope the first matcher or comment the intent.

### WP-Hooks-tail — **P3** (+ one human-gated, one decision)
- **H-2 remainder** (gap): the journal *format* fork is closed (WP-4 shared helper), but trigger heuristics stay loose — matcher is `"Bash"` only (**misses PowerShell commits — relevant on this machine**), fires on any command *containing* `git commit`, doesn't check command success. Plus the hook still has zero tests.
- **H-3 remainder** (gap): the fatal-failure case is fixed (`session-start.sh:59` now `… || true`), but sync/prime/reinject still discard stderr to `/dev/null` — no diagnostic breadcrumb when something fails. A log under `.cognition/` or plugin-data would make these diagnosable.
- **H-4** (gap, inferred — **human-machine gate**): first-install race (server `uv run` self-sync vs hook `uv sync` on the same multi-GB torch venv); `plugin.json` hard-codes the venv path with no fallback. Per constraint `b8ec24fe9107`, verify on a human machine at a release.
- **H-6 remainder** (LOW): `backfill.py` unused `json` import + unexposed `days` param + git failures swallowed; `migrate_mcp` would skip a UTF-8-BOM `.mcp.json` (`utf-8-sig` would migrate it); redundant hatch `force-include`; stale `session-start.sh` header comment.

### WP-Test · the coverage hole — **P1-infra**
- **T-1** (MED, gap): the entire 15-tool MCP layer has zero tests — every contract bug in WP-T/WP-Cap lives in that untested layer. Also untested: `prime.py` (its stdout *is* the hook payload), `post-commit.py` (journal format contract unpinned), `config.py` (the whole plugin-launch story), `instructions.py`, `server.py` lifespan. **Cross-process append test** (current `TestJournalCatchUp` is single-process) would shrink the human-machine gate. *Natural companion to WP-T — write the tool suite alongside the tool fixes.*

## Decisions needed from Colton

1. **H-6 — `.cognition/` commit-vs-ignore (chromadb).** The intent (commit the journal, gitignore
   `chromadb/`) is half-implemented: `.gitignore` has **no `.cognition/chromadb/` line** and
   `.cognition/` itself sits untracked, while `config.py:98/103` docstrings disagree (one says
   "Git-committed", one says "gitignored"). Decide the policy, then align `.gitignore` +
   docstrings + README in one pass. (Low effort; just needs the call.)

## Owed / tracking

- **v0.7.4 post-pin machine test** (Colton, AM): non-ASCII commit message → clean journal, on a
  real Windows machine (install-mechanics gate `b8ec24fe9107`). Rollback if it fails = re-pin to
  v0.7.3 SHA `d6c2f45`. Pin is **live** at `20519b9`.
